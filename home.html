            <h2>Learn about the different types of skin</h2>

            <p>Several criteria are used to classify the different types of skin.
                 For example, Fitzpatrick's classification, first described in 1975,
                 is based on skin color and its response to sun exposure.
                 It is used to determine the proper type of sun protection factor or 
                 to predict the risk of skin cancer, among others. However,
                 from a cosmetic point of view, skin is classified according to several factors related to
                 its balance: sebaceous secretion, hydration and sensitivity level.
                 Thus, each type of skin will have its own characteristics and require different cares.
                 The type of skin is determined by genetics,
                 although it will also be affected by other factors and can change with time.
                 Based on these characteristics, there are four types of healthy skin: normal,
                 dry, oily,and combination (both oily and dry skin)  . Below, 
                 we describe the main characteristics of each type of skin.

        <section class="normal">
            <h2>NORMAL SKIN</h2> 
            <p>
                This skin is neither too dry nor too oily. 
                It has regular texture, no imperfections and a clean, soft appearance,
                 and does not need special care.

            <h2>DRY SKIN</h2>
            <p>
                In many cases, dry skin is caused by external factors such as the weather,
                low air humidity and immersion in hot water, and it is usually temporary.
                However, for some people it may occur more often and even be a lifelong condition.
                Since dry skin can crack leaving it more exposed to bacteria,
                although in general this is not serious, it may cause other skin disorders, 
                such as eczema, or be more prone to infections if not properly managed.
                Dry skin signs and symptoms may vary depending on different factors such as age,
                health status or their cause.
                It is generally characterized by a feeling of tightness and roughness.
                It may also acquire an ashy gray color, with occurrence of desquamation,
                itching, redness and small cracks.
                Cracked skin is usually observed in very dry skin and presents small cracks,
                which, in more serious cases, may be deeper and even bleed.
                Atopic skin is a skin disease characterized by dry skin
                that leads to desquamation and irritation and causes upsetting symptoms,
                such as itching. The main cause is genetic predisposition,
                although other factors may trigger its occurrence or aggravate the condition as well,
                which may be environmental, allergic, related with food and even with some clothes.

        <section class="oil">
            <h2>OILY SKIN</h2>

            <p>
                Oily skin has a porous, humid and bright appearance.
                It is caused by excessive fat production by sebaceous glands,
                and usually determined by genetic and/or hormonal causes.
                It is frequent in adolescents and young people under 30 years old,
                and usually related with the occurrence of acne.

            <h2>COMBINATION SKIN</h2>
            <p>
                Based on its location, 
                it presents characteristics of both dry and oily 
                skin since the distribution of sebaceous and sweat glands is not homogeneous.
                The area with more oil is usually the T- zone (forehead, nose, and chin),
                 while the skin on the cheeks is normal or dry.
