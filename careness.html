                <p>
                    Whatever the type of skin, it must be taken care of daily,
                    in order to maintain its freshness and vitality, 
                    and despite the availability of many products
                    that may make a lady fall into confusion to choose the most suitable among them, 
                    there are basic habits that must be followed for daily skin care,
                    and we will know the most important steps For daily care
                </p>
            </div>

              <h1>Daily skin care</h1>
            
               <p class="one ">
                 1. Cleansing: Choose a cleanser that doesn’t leave your skin tight after washing.
                 Clean your face no more than twice a day, or just once, 
                 if you have dry skin and don’t wear makeup. Avoid washing for that squeaky-clean
                 feeling because that means your skin’s natural oils are gone.
                 Cleansers known to work well for all skin types include Cetaphil and Banila Clean
                  It Zero Sherbet Cleanser.
                 </p>    
                 <p class="two">
                  2. Serums: A serum with vitamin C or growth factors or peptides would be better in
                    the morning, under sunscreen. At night, retinol or prescription retinoids work best.
                    Makeup Artist’s Choice has an effective vitamin C and E serum and retinol available.
                   
                 </p>

            
                 <p class="theree">
                    3. Moisturizer: Even oily skin needs moisturizer, but use one that is lightweight,
                     gel-based, and non-comedogenic, or doesn’t block your pores, like CeraVe’s facial lotion.
                     Dry skin may benefit from more cream-based moisturizers like MISSHA Super Aqua Cell Renew
                     Snail Cream. Most brands will label their products as gel or cream on their packaging.</p>
                 <p class="four">
                    4. Sunscreen: Apply sunscreen with at least 30 SPF 15 minutes before heading outdoors,
                     as it takes a while for sunscreen to activate. Darker skin tones actually need more sun
                    protection because hyperpigmentation is harder to correct. Try EltaMD’s sunscreen,
                    which offers broad-spectrum UVA/UVB protection and is recommended by the Skin Cancer 
                    Foundation.
                 </p >
                
                  <p class="five">
                     Choose products that fit your skin type and sensitivity,
                     and remember to read the labels. Some products, such as retinol or prescription retinoids,
                     should only be applied at night.
